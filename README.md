* Question 2: Nice use of functional programming! Legends are hard with `tmap_arrange`<p>
* Question 3: This works.<p>
* Question 4: You do a good job with significance and direction, but could say more about magnitude. How big are these coefficients given the units of measurement for the variables?<p>
* Question 5: Good<p>
* Question 6: You do a better job here than in Q4. For variables with small unites (population), consider aggregating those numbers--not increase per person, but increase per 10,000 people.<p>
* Question 7: Good<p>
* Question 8: Good<p>
* Question 9: This works--could also try to identify which variables appear most important.<p>
* Challenge: <p>
